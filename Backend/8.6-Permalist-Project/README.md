*** DONE ***
1. Error handling (shouldn't add an empty string or item too long)
2. Add complete by field
3. Sort by complete by field
4. Add sorting (Name, Creation date, Complete By + ASC/DESC)
5. Add a calendar view
  - Change it to just current month, and then you can click forward and backward (back to a certain point only)
  - Should show no calendar text on smaller, and calendar on bigger, refresh and resize
  - Highlight current day in current month
6. 

*** Ideas for improvement ***
**** MVP ****
- Add authentication and make changes accordingly (another table for users that is linked to the items table through user id)
- Prevent spamming and DDOS

**** Stretch Goals ****
- Add tags (2 max) to each item
- Add filter by tags
- Integrate list with AI tool - after getting to do items from tool, drag them and drop into calendar days
- change display: none; of calendar view on mobile, to JS logic
